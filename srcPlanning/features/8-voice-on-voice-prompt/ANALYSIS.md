Based on my analysis of the codebase and PRD requirements, here's my engineering analysis:

## Analysis: Voice-on-Voice Prompt Feature

**Complexity: Medium (M)**

**Goal**: Enable voice-to-voice conversations with Claude Code to collaboratively draft PRDs, which then become actionable prompts for development work.

**Key Risks:**
- Voice integration dependency on external Claude CLI `--mic` functionality
- Audio quality/transcription accuracy affecting PRD quality
- User experience complexity in voice workflow vs existing text-based flow
- Potential conflicts with existing `cmdPromptVoice` implementation

**Dependencies:**
- Claude CLI with microphone support (`--mic` flag)
- Current ticket system (git branch-based workflow)
- MCP voice-mode tools (potentially available but not currently used)
- File system operations for PROMPT.md generation

**Test Strategy:**
- Unit tests for new voice session initialization
- Integration tests with mock Claude CLI responses
- Manual testing of voice workflow end-to-end
- Validation of generated PROMPT.md content quality

**3-Step Implementation Plan:**

1. **Extend Current Voice Command** - Enhance `cmdPromptVoice` in `/Users/adentranter/Projects/letscode/src/commands/prompt.ts:25` to support bidirectional conversation mode, enabling iterative PRD refinement through voice interaction.

2. **Add Conversation State Management** - Implement session persistence to maintain context across voice interactions, allowing users to resume and refine PRD conversations over multiple sessions.

3. **Integrate Voice Session Output** - Ensure voice conversations automatically generate structured PROMPT.md files with proper PRD sections (Goal, Scope, Acceptance, Risks, Milestones) that feed into the existing analysis pipeline.

The feature builds well on existing infrastructure (`cmdPromptVoice`, `cmdPromptAnalyze`) and follows established patterns in the codebase.
